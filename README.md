Questions:

Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

1) Over 56% of the campaigns were successful with "theater campaigns" being the most popular among all categories.   
2) "Food and Games campaigns" presented the worst success rate (less than 50%). 
3) Campaigns launched in June/July presented the best results, while the ones launched in August tended to fail.    

What are some limitations of this dataset?
- Most of the data (over 76%) correspond to projects launched in the US so it does not demonstrate a real global tedency. 

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
- Campaign duration vs outcome; this would help us understand if there is an optimum timeline to succeed. 
- Location (country) vs category; this would help us understand what are the backers preferences at each location.  

Statistical Analysis

Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
The median better summarizes the date since there is not a normal distribution on the data set.  

Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
There are more variability with successful campaigns. It makes sense since successful campaigns will have more backers compared to unsuccessful ones.
